0,0,0,2,"Generally calm people of Reddit, what made you lose your absolute shit that time?","It's always felt like my parents never wanted me. I was a surprise Honeymoon baby born 9 months and a day after their wedding, I was regularly screamed at for anything I did until I just started hiding, I was called ""the practice child"" my whole life, my younger siblings got way more love and attention, etc. In my teens they started taking in ""strays"". If any neighborhood kids didn't want to go home, they could just be at our house all the time. Effectively, my mother would take my friends away from me to be *HER* friends instead. One of which was a kid who picked on me constantly from the time I was 11. I guess they had that in common. That guy was kicked out of his Dad's house AND his mom's house when he was 20, so my parents took him in permanently. That killed me. But I always wanted their approval, so I was always calm and agreeable, always desperately trying to figure out how to get them to love me, so I went along with it. Years later, I'm married and have a son. This guy still lives with my parents. They continue to coddle and make excuses for him while criticising me for whatever they feel like. One day, we're all at my parents house and my son is being a goofy 2-year-old, which annoys the man-child living there. So he gets furious, picks my son up by his ankle and spanks him. My parents claimed not to have seen it. We went home. I couldn't sleep that night because I was so upset. The next morning, I made sure the guy and my mom would be at home (and why wouldn't he be there) and I went to confront them with my wife. I dumped ***everything*** I had been putting up with on them for about an hour, including asking how my mom could allow this jerk to hit my son. She maintained that it didn't happen, so I went through the roof. I ended up crying because of all the pent-up emotion, so my fantastic wife took over. She said we wouldn't be coming back if the guy still lived there, so he yelled that he would move out and he stormed off after saying he didn't have to listen to this. My parents convinced him ***not*** to move out shortly after we left. My mother expressed how disappointed she was that I didn't come ""to have a conversation"", and only came to ""dump"" on them. ***THAT*** was her big takeaway from everything I said. That I wasn't being ""fair"" to them. We went to counseling with them later. For months. It validated everything I had felt, but they never stopped lying and being defensive. One counselor said we should be on Dr. Phil. The other counselor said my mom is ""incapable of empathy"". Both counselors called my parents delusional. But of course my parents didn't take any of that seriously. At one point my dad asked me ""Who does he think he is to judge us like that?"", as if he forgot that THAT'S THEIR JOB. Haven't spoken with them in almost a year, and life is so much better.","Hope you never speak to them again, they dont deserve you OP"
