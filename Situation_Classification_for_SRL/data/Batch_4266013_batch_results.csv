Thinking of young girl found guilty in Cyprus who will be able to appeal to them - is that bcs it happened in Cyprus ? It ’ s an awful shame if it ’ s taken from us post brexit imo @USER <br>Context 1 -> @USER @USER The UK will still be a party to the ECHR , under which the European Court of Human Rights has mandatory jurisdiction . It's not really an appeal - people can only go to that Court if they have exhausted all possible appeals within the national legal system . <br>Response  => @USER @USER Thank you for clarification . I gathered it was the last port of call when all else was exhausted . However , I seem to remember that one of the many slogans banded about pre - #EURef2016 was #takingbackcontrol . Do brexiteers know that ECHR can still overrule UK law ? :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:","No"
