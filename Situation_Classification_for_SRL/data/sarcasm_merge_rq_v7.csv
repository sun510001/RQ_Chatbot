With the DND clogged up , to be fair if I go to office early enough in the AM I can use the DND but in the evenings , I ’ m forced to use Nizamuddin . So on average I ’ m driving ten clicks more daily . <br>Context 2 -> Which in the car I ’ m driving right now is about a litre of petrol , so ₹ 75 . But you could argue that that much money wouldn ’ t hurt someone like me .

4631,"Context 0 -> The question that has never clearly been answered to me when I have posed it : “ What would Trump have to do to lose your support ? ” The long pauses and blank stares are scary . For those this applies to - feel free to answer . <br>Context 1 -> @USER The economy is good , he is securing our borders , people are working which brings self worth . He is pro life , is protecting American interests worldwide , is working on prison reform and is protecting Christian liberties here and abroad . All of the things he said he would do . <br>Context 2 -> @USER @USER anyone who votes for Trump due to religious beliefs is kidding themselves . Apparently , the chosen one is someone divorced multiple times , has 30 + sexual assault accusations against him , including raping a 13 yr old . Yes , raping a 13 yr old . That's who you vote for . <br>Context 3 -> @USER @USER It is amazing how far the left will go to discredit someone . It certainly has been shown time and time again how low they will go .

That explains your level of intelligence . <br>Context 5 -> @USER @USER And as usual the left offers NOTHING of substance and resorts to personal attacks ! You folks are consistent . Appreciate you adding to the status quo ! Continue on ... <br>Context 6 -> @USER @USER No reason to argue facts since your party doesn't deal in them . If Trump is Innocent he should be allowing witnesses and documents . But we all know he's not and that's because he's already , and will forever be , IMPEACHED . <br>Response  => @USER @USER Continue living in your fantasy world ! Trump will be YOUR President until the year 2024 . Gonna have to figure out a way to deal ! Did you hear the Natty crowd chanting USA ? ? ?"

All disastrous for the UK which has a negative current account balance . Happy now ? <br>Context 2 -> @USER She didnt say she would rejoin . She said if the conditions proved true , that rejoining would be better economically , she would support that . Keep up champ . <br>Response  => @USER “ If rejoining would be better economically ” - shows how little she knows about macro then doesn ’ t it ? Because rejoining would mean pegging our currency or joining the Euro which would turn us into Greece ( considering our Debt / GDP ratio and current account balance )"

4653,"Context 0 -> I want to share one of my favourite song . :hugging_face: I first heard this song when I was about 13 years old & it's forever imprinted in my heart . Just watching the MV itself was both shocking & encouraging for the young me back then . #ChristinaAguilera :URL: <br>Context 1 -> Growing up in a rural area in an Asian country , many "" ideas "" presented in this MV was unthinkable for me at that time yet it was surprisingly easy for me to accept . It was also around this age when I realized I'm relatively more open & my thinking different from others around me . <br>Context 2 -> I guess my depression already started though back then I wasn't really aware , thought that harming myself to feel better is normal / OK . But this song's lyrics & video really left a mark on me . What about "" flaws "" ? What about "" differences "" ?
