            <h2> Instructions </h2>
            <p>A rhetorical question(RQ) is a question someone asks without expecting an answer.
                The question might not have an answer, or it might have an obvious answer.</p>
            <p>People use RQ to achieve a pragmatic goal,
            such as structuring an argument, being persuasive, emphasizing a point, or being ironic.</p>
            <p><b>Example 1</b>: </p>
                <p><b>Context 0</b> -> Spare The Rod , Spoil The Child . Gee , I Wonder Where That Came From ? ( sarcasm ) URL <br>
                <b>Context 1</b> -> @USER @USER @USER No jokes Joe . This is where all things started to go wrong <br>
                <b>Response</b>  => @USER @USER @USER What Jokes ? Spare The Rod , Spoil The Child . It Comes From The Bible That These URL <br>
            </p>
            <p>The Response in Example 1 is a <b>RQ</b>, because <b>"What Jokes ?"</b> is not a information-seeking question. It emphasizes a point.</p>

            <p><b>Example 2</b>: </p>
                <p><b>Context 0</b> -> Do you know me? <br>
                <b>Response</b>  => Does an art student know Picasso? <br>
            </p>
            <p>The Response in Example 2 is a <b>RQ</b>, too.</p>
